This is a lab for the artificial intelligence class at MSU focusing on solving the flow app. 

Done by Peter Gifford and Sam Behrens.

The thing about the smart one is it is using most constrained and only checking possible values not all values, and when we set these possible values we are adding the closest ones first, which makes it have better performance because it will choose the closest value and put it in first and try it first
